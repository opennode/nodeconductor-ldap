Configuration
-------------

It is possible to integrate LDAP with permission group by establishing a synchronisation link between membership
in LDAP groups and in configured Django groups. A typical scenario for that delegation of user membership management
to a single component (LDAP) in the system.

For the moment, it is done by:

- configuring LDAP access from NodeConductor
- creating a new *nodeconductor.ldapsync.models.LdapToGroup* instance
  and specifying LDAP group name and the target Django group

To enable LDAP support, please update `settings.py` (probably located in /etc/nodeconductor/ if installed from RPMs)
to enable LDAPBackend:

.. code-block:: python

    AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS += (
        'django_auth_ldap.backend.LDAPBackend',
    )
